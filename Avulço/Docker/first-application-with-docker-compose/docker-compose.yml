# A docker-compose must always start by the version tag.
# We use '3' because it's the last version at this time.

version: '3'

# You should know that docker-composes works with services.
# 1 service = 1 container.
# For example, a service maybe, a server, a client, a database...
# We use the keyword 'services' to start to create services.
# We are going to create two services: a server and a client.

services:
  server:
    # Here 'server/' corresponds to the path to the server folder
    # that contains the Dockerfile to use.
    build: server/
    # the command to execute once the image is created.
    command: python ./server.py 
    ports:
      - 1234:1234

  client:
    build: client/
    command: python ./client.py

    # The keyword 'network_mode' is used to define the network type.
    # Here we define that the container can access to the 'localhost' of the computer.
    network_mode: host

    # The keyword'depends_on' allows you to define whether the service should wait until other services are ready before launching.
    # Here, we want the 'client' service to wait until the 'server' service is ready.
    depends_on:
      - server

    # docker-compose build (comand to build the client/server application)
    # docker-compose up (run the application)
